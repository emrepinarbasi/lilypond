Sometimes chords with a stretched fingering are required.  If not
otherwise specified the context-property @code{maximumFretStretch} is
set to @code{4}, though. Resulting in a warning about \"No string for
pitch ...\" and the note is omitted.  You may set
@code{maximumFretStretch} to an approppriate value or explecitely
assign string-numbers to all notes of a chord.
