#  Extract grammar and index from bison output file `parser.output',
#  dropping all of the state information.  Additionally,
#
#  * convert `\\' to `\',
#  * eliminate the `@' variables created when `{}' is placed
#    in the middle of a rule,
#  * eliminate all of the c-code stuff, and
#  * wrap lines that are longer than 78 characters for improved
#    formatting.
#
# Run
#
#   bison -v parser.yy

# to create file `parser.output', then run
